        name: 'Rekno – Knowledge Graph & Memory Simulator',
        description: "I built Rekno, an advanced personal knowledge management system inspired by cognitive memory processes. It uses a visual knowledge graph where conceptual connections decay over time and can be manually reinforced. I implemented a custom Java backend with a RESTful API and an interactive frontend using vis.js, CSS animations, and glass morphism design. Major features include dark/light theme toggle with localStorage, PDF/PNG export, smart search, responsive UI, zoom controls, and animated toast notifications. This project deepened my understanding of custom HTTP servers, graph data structures, memory simulation, and accessible, modern frontend design.",
